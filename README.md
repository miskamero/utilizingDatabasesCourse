# Utilizing Databases Course

## Overview

This course was designed to provide an introduction to databases and SQL using C# with the Entity Framework and MS SQL Server. The course is designed to be hands-on and interactive, with a focus on practical applications of database concepts.
**Note:** This was my first time ever working with C# and Entity Framework, so I had to learn a lot of new things in a short amount of time. I am proud of the work I did in this course, but I know that my code can be optimized and improved alot.
